# Handwritten_Digit_GAN
This project involves creating a Handwritten Digit Generator using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The GAN model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains images of handwritten digits (0-9). The generator produces realistic images of handwritten digits, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real images from the dataset and generated images from the generator.
Objectives:
Generator: To create realistic-looking handwritten digit images that resemble the images from the MNIST dataset.
Discriminator: To classify whether a given image is real (from the dataset) or fake (produced by the generator).
GAN: To train the generator and discriminator in an adversarial setup, improving the generator's ability to produce realistic images over time.
Dataset:
MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset
60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
Each image is a 28x28 grayscale image of handwritten digits (0-9).
